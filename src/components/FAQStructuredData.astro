Follow signs to the terminal shuttle, then proceed to baggage claim where your driver will be waiting at the base of the escalator on level 2 with a sign bearing your name. For international flights, your driver will be on standby close to the airport. Clear customs and notify your driver. Remember to check your phone upon arrival for updates. Both scenarios involve meeting the driver at baggage claim level 2, with luggage assistance available upon request for additional fees."
